Nkosingizwile Bongiwe Ndlovu is a Research Operations Intern at the [South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI)](https://www.sanbi.org) and a Master's student in Geoinformatics at the [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/). Her research focuses on assessing hydrological regime changes in lacustrine wetlands on the Maputaland Coastal Plain, South Africa — contributing to [SDG Indicator 6.6.1a](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6) and the [Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Goal A)](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/).

She applies  [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), to conduct time-series analysis of Sentinel-1A, and Landsat 5/7 imagery, using multi-index water detection algorithms. She complements this with [TIMESAT](https://web.nateko.lu.se/timesat/) for hydrological metrics modelling, and  [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) for spatial mapping and geostatistical analysis. Her work supports sustainable environmental decision-making.

Nkosingizwile actively participates in stakeholder engagement initiatives through collaborations with [SAEON](https://www.saeon.ac.za/), the [Water Research Commission (WRC)](https://www.wrc.org.za/), and [WILDTRUST (WILDLANDS)](https://wildtrust.co.za/). She has presented at climate vulnerability workshops and shared research with community leaders, including the Mabaso and Tembe Traditional Authorities in Maputaland, to identify local environmental risks and adaptation strategies.

She has presented her work at:
- [**The National Wetlands Indaba 2023**] (https://www.up.ac.za/geography-geoinformatics-and-meteorology/news/post_3191281-good-representation-at-the-national-wetlands-indaba-2023)
- **The SSAG Student Conference 2024** (Wetland Hydrology and Monitoring session)
- [**The National Space Conference 2024**] (https://www.up.ac.za/geography-geoinformatics-and-meteorology/news/post_3255703-intersecting-of-space-science-and-sustainability)

Her technical skills include remote sensing, wetland monitoring, multispectral image processing, land-use modeling, geostatistics (e.g., kriging, interpolation), and programming in Python and JavaScript. She is passionate about leveraging cloud-based geospatial platforms to drive climate resilience, biodiversity conservation, and evidence-based environmental management in southern Africa.
