### üó∫Ô∏è Mapping of Soil Erosion in the Upper Molopo River Catchment Using GIS and Remote Sensing  
**BSc Honours Research Project**  
**University of Pretoria**

This project focused on estimating and mapping soil erosion risk in the Upper Molopo River Catchment (UMRC) using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model integrated within a GIS and Remote Sensing framework. Due to limited field data, all RUSLE parameters (R, K, LS, C, and P) were derived using remote sensing, spatial interpolation, and publicly available datasets.

#### üîç Methods and Tools Used

- **Rainfall Erosivity (R)**: Calculated using rainfall records from 2014‚Äì2018 based on the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) equation.
- **Soil Erodibility (K)**: Estimated from ISRIC Soil Info data at 24 GPS-logged sites. Interpolated using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) in ArcGIS.
- **Topographic Factor (LS)**: Derived from DEM using slope and flow accumulation in ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine.
- **Cover Management (C)**: Computed using NDVI from Spot vegetation imagery and classified using ArcGIS spatial analyst tools.
- **Support Practice (P)**: Assigned a value of 1 due to absence of conservation practices in the area.
- **Annual Soil Loss**: Final raster calculated using ArcGIS Raster Calculator applying the full RUSLE equation: `A = R * K * LS * C * P`.

#### üå± Impact

This project produced a spatially explicit map of soil erosion risk, identifying high-risk zones within the catchment. The outputs provide a foundation for future land use planning and conservation, especially in data-scarce regions. The study also demonstrates the potential of remote sensing and open-access data to conduct robust environmental assessments in under-resourced areas.
