## Overview

This project was developed as part of my BSc Biology and Geography;Software Engineering module by a team of six members. The aim was to address the issue of limited post-matric information accessible to recent high school graduates in South Africa. Many matriculants are unaware of the full range of academic and career opportunities available to them, contributing to high levels of unemployment and associated social issues such as crime.

The **Post-Matric Information System** is a web-based platform designed to centralize and simplify access to information about:
- University and University of Technology courses
- Government and private learnership programs
- Entry-level job opportunities
- Entrepreneurial paths and guidance

## Objectives

- Provide a user-friendly platform for matriculants to access post-school opportunities
