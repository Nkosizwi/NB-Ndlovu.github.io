## Overview

As part of my role as a **Research Operations Intern** at the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), I developed a custom desktop application to streamline library data workflows. The application automates the process of **capturing bibliographic data** from the **OCLC WorldShare Catalog** and exporting it into structured Excel spreadsheets.

This tool enhances data accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in the cataloging processâ€”supporting the SANBI Library team in maintaining high-quality metadata and reducing manual effort.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (for scripting and automation)
- **Tkinter** (GUI interface)
- **openpyxl / pandas** (Excel data handling)
- **Regular expressions** (data parsing from raw text)
- **Selenium** (for web scraping, if applicable)

## My Role & Contributions

- Designed the app interface and functionality to meet SANBI Library requirements  
- Developed backend logic to parse bibliographic records from OCLC WorldShare Catalog  
- Implemented export functionality to generate clean, structured Excel spreadsheets  
- Tested the app for reliability and ease of use in daily workflows  
- Delivered the final working product and provided documentation and user guidance  

## Outcome

The tool is now actively used in the SANBI Library to assist with cataloging and data extraction tasks, saving significant time and reducing errors.Due to confidentiality, code and screenshots are not publicly shared.
